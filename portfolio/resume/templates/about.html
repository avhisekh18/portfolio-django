        <p class="lead">Django Backend Developer</p>
        <p class="py-3">
         Hello, I’m <span class="text">Avhisekh Dhungana</span>, a passionate and detail-oriented developer with a strong focus on backend development using Python and Django. I enjoy building dynamic, user-friendly web applications and continuously strive to learn and implement new technologies. Alongside my backend expertise, I’m also deeply enthusiastic about DevOps tools—skilled in Docker, Jenkins, Ansible, Grafana, and Prometheus—which I use to streamline development, automate processes, and enhance application performance. My goal is to create impactful digital experiences by combining solid backend foundations with efficient DevOps practices.
